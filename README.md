# 🔐Password Generator App

A simple and interactive **Password Gnerator Web App that I also sent to the web** built using **HTML, CSS, AND JAVASCRIPT**, This project generates random secure passwords and allows to easily copy them with a single click

---

## Features

- Generates **two random passwords** at once
- Each password is **15 characters long**
- Uppercase letters (A-Z)
- Lowercase letters (a-z)
- Numbers (0-9)
- Special symbols (!@#$%^&*)
- Click password to **copy it to clipboard**
- Tooltip appears on hover: **"Copy Password"**
- Smooth hover effects and clean UI

- ## Tech Stack
- **HTML** - Structure
- **CSS** - Styling & layout (flexbox, hover effects, tooltip)
- **Javascript** - Logic & interactivity

## Project Structure

```
PasswordGenerator
│
├── index.html     # Main HTML structure
├── index.js       # Password generation & copy logic
└── styles.css     # Styling and layout
```

## How it works 
- A predifined array containing all possible characters
- A loop runs 15 times
- Each iteration:
   - Picks a random character
   - Appends it to the password string

### Copy to clipboard
- Clicking a password triggers:

  ```js
  navigator.clipboard.writeText(password)

## Future Updates(I will work on this a bit longer and this are the features I will add everyday)
Note: I wont be able to update this everyday because of school but I'll try since I actually want to make an actual project that isnt just sent here and never updated, because that beats the purpose of making repositories literally, also note that I've only been learning how to use HTML, CSS, JAVASCIPT FOR about a month since I used to be a python programmer, so don't expect the code to be perfect

1. "Copied!" feedback - replace tootip text with **Copied!** for 1 second
2. Password length control - Add some kind of input that can be customize base on how long the password length you want it to be 
3. Slider for length (better UX) - will use range input instead of number
4. Include.exclude options - CHECKBOXES
5. Color feedback - change password bpx color when copied
6. Regenerate button animation - Add click animation or shake effect
7. Password strength indicator - strong, medium and weak
8. Dark/Light mode toggle
9. Mobile responsiveness - make it look the same when you open it on phones
10. Export passwords - be able to download the password as .txt
